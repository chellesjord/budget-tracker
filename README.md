  ## Description:
  In this project I was givien an existing budget tracker application and was tasked to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total is updated when they're brought back online. App is deployed on Heroku.

To test the applications offline capabilty open Developer Tools in the browser, click the Network tab, and change the Throttling to "Offline". Input a sample transaction while offline, then turn the Throttling back to "No Throttling". The app should update with your transaction without further action.
